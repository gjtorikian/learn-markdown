Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It's written in what nerds like to
call "plaintext," which is exactly what it sounds like, the text you're used to writing. Plaintext
is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( <code>*</code>) and
backticks ( <code>`</code>) thrown in.

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in
Markdown can be shared easily between computers, mobile phones, and people. It's
quickly becoming the writing standard for [academics][academics],
[scientists][scientists],
and [creative people][writers].
Websites like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and [reddit](http://www.reddit.com)
use Markdown to style their comments.

Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve. It doesn't do anything 
fancy like control the font size, color, or type. All you can control is the 
formatting of the textâ€”stuff like making things bold, creating headers, and organizing lists.

If you have ten minutes, you can learn Markdown too!

In each lesson, you'll be given an introduction to a single Markdown concept, and then you'll
be presented with a few exercises using that new knowledge.
