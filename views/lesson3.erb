<p>We'll now learn how to make links to other web sites on the world wide web.</p>

<p>There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them
  render the exact same way. The first link style is called an
  <em>inline link</em>. To create an inline link, you wrap the link
  text in brackets ( <code>[ ]</code> ), and then you wrap the link in
  parenthesis ( <code>( )</code> ). For example, to create a hyperlink
  to http://www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!,
  you'd write this in Markdown: <code>[Visit
  GitHub!](http://www.github.com)</code>.</p>

<p>In the box below, make a link to http://www.google.com, with some text that says "Search for it."</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span5 scratchpad"></div>
  <span class="help-tooltip icon-question" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="You'll type your answers in the left box; the Markdown result will appear in the right box. When your answer is correct, you'll be taken to the next lesson"></span>
  <div class="span5 renderpad"></div>
</div>

  <p>Nice work!</p>
  <p>You can add emphasis to link texts, if you like. In the box below, make the
  phrase "really, really" bold, and have the entire sentence link to http://www.dailykitten.com.
  You'll want to make sure that the bold phrasing occurs within the link text brackets.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="span5 renderpad"></div>

  <p>Fantastic!</p>
  <p>Although it might make for an awkward experience, you can make links within
  headers, too.</p>
  <p>For this next tutorial, make the text a heading four, and turn the phrase
  "the BBC" into a link to http://www.bbc.com/news:</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="span5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>

  <p>That's all there is to writing inline links.</p>
  <p>The other link type is called a <em>reference</em> link. As the name implies,
    the link is actually a reference to another place. Here's an example of what
    we mean:</p>
  <pre>
     Here's [a link to something else][another place].
     Here's [yet another link][another-link].
     And now back to [the first link][another place].

     [another place]: http://www.github.com
     [another-link]: http://www.google.com
  </pre>
  <p>The "references" above are the second set of brackets: <code>[another place]</code> and
    <code>[another-link]</code>. At the bottom of a Markdown document, these brackets are defined
    as proper links to outside website. An advantage of the reference link style
    is that multiple links to the same place only need to be updated once. For
    example, if we decide to make all of the <code>[another place]</code> links go somewhere
    else, we only have to change the single reference link.</p>
  <p>Reference links don't appear in the rendered Markdown. You define them by providing
    the same tag name wrapped in brackets, followed by a colon, followed by the link.</p>
  <p>In the box below, we've started writing out some reference links. You'll
    need to finish them up! Call the first reference tag "a fun place", and make
    it link to http://www.zombo.com; make the second link out to http://www.stumbleupon.com.</p>
