<p>Once you know how to create links in Markdown, you can create images too. The
  syntax is nearly the same.</p>
<p>The difference is that an image
starts with an exclamation point ( <code>!</code> ), followed by the same square brackets containing the "alt text" for the image,
and a pair of parenthesis containing the image URL. The "alt text" is a phrase or sentance that describes the
image for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>Images also have two styles, just like links. To create an inline image, you'll use
  the same syntax as an inline link. </p>

<p>In the box below, turn the link to an image and fill out the alt text brackets
   to say "A representation of Octdrey Catburn":</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="span5 scratchpad"></div>
  <span class="help-tooltip icon-question" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="You'll type your answers in the left box; the Markdown result will appear in the right box. When your answer is correct, you'll be taken to the next lesson"></span>
  <div class="span5 renderpad"></div>
</div>

  <p>Wonderful!</p>
  <p>Alt text isn't <em>required</em>, but it's considered useful and polite
     for the visually impaired. If you don't want to add alt text, just leave the square brackets empty.</p>
  <p>For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link.
    You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide a set of square brackets
    for the alt text, and then another set for the image tag. At the bottom of your Markdown
    page, you'll define an image for the tag.</p>
  <p>In the box below, we've started placing some reference images. You'll
    need to complete them just like the last lesson. Call the first reference tag "First Father" and make
    it link to http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg, then make the
    second image link out to http://octodex.github.com/images/foundingfather_v2.png.</p>
