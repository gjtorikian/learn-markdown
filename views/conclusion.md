Congratulations! There are no more lessons left!

Believe it or not, we've only scratched the beginnings of what can be accomplished
with Markdown. There are many non-standard implementations of Markdown that supports
things like tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more. Because
they're non-standard, they're not essential to learning the basics, which we've
introduced here.

If you'd like to know more about these Markdown implementations, you're welcome
to explore any number of other Markdown apps and tutorials:
